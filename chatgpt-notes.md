## Purpose
This document records how I used ChatGPT to plan and build the **Book Finder React Application** for the take-home challenge.

## ðŸ§© What I Asked ChatGPT
1. To explain the assignment and help me choose the best idea (Book Finder).
2. To provide step-by-step guidance to build it from scratch in CodeSandbox.
3. To generate clean React code and responsive CSS.
4. To help me write a professional README for GitHub submission.

## How I Used ChatGPTâ€™s Guidance
- Copied the suggested React code into my CodeSandbox.
- Customized the UI (colors, fonts, layout).
- Tested API endpoints (Open Library Search API).
- Implemented error handling and loading states.
- Created this README and notes using ChatGPTâ€™s templates.

## Reflection
ChatGPT helped me:
- Understand how to structure a React project.
- Write clean, commented code.
- Save time setting up UI and API logic.
- Focus on testing and presentation quality.



**Total Contribution:**  
ChatGPT acted as a mentor / guide.  
All code, testing, and final debugging were done by me (Aripirala Pallavi).
